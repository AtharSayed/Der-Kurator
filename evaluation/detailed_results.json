The 991 is an evolution of the 992, featuring subtle aerodynamic enhancements, revised bumpers, updated lighting signatures, and new wheel designs that contribute to improved efficiency and road presence. It also has a more advanced interior with increased space for passengers and luggage.\n\nIn terms of technical specifications, the 991 generation is powered by a flat-six engine, while the 997 features a naturally aspirated flat-six or a turbocharged flat-six engine. The 991 also has a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission, while the 997 has a six-speed manual or optional PDK dual-clutch transmission.\n\nThe 991 generation is available in various models, including the Carrera, Turbo S, and GT3 RS, with power outputs ranging from 402 hp to 640 hp. The 997, on the other hand, is available in various models, including the Carrera, Turbo S, and GT3 RS, with power outputs ranging from 351 hp to 640 hp.\n\nOverall, while both generations are iconic Porsche models, they differ in terms of design, technology, and technical specifications.",
